## Overview

Sentry retains different types of data for varying periods based on your plan tier and the specific data type. This policy outlines the retention periods for all event data types across our Developer, Team, and Business plans.

## Default Data Retention by Plan

| Data Type | Developer | Team | Business |
|-----------|-----------|------|----------|
| [Errors](/concepts/key-terms/enrich-data/) | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| [Logs](/product/explore/logs/) | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days |
| [Spans/Transactions](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/distributed-tracing/) | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days + 13 months sampled |
| [Session Replays](/product/explore/session-replay/web/) | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| [Profiles](/product/explore/profiling/) | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| [Crons](/product/crons/) | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days |
| [Uptime](/product/monitoring/) | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| [Attachments](/product/issues/issue-details/attachments/) | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| [Releases](/product/releases/) | Permanent | Permanent | Permanent |

<Alert>
Starting November 2025, Team and Business plans will move from the current 90 day retention period for spans and transactions, to 30 days. If you are on a [Team or Business plan](https://sentry.io/settings/billing/overview/) that uses transaction-based billing, retention will stay at 90 days.
</Alert>

## Sampled Retention for Business Plans

Business plan customers receive extended retention for spans data through our sampled retention feature. This provides:

- **Full fidelity data**: 90 days of complete span data
- **Sampled data**: 13 months of downsampled span data 

The 13-month sampled retention period allows for year-over-year comparisons and trend analysis while maintaining reasonable storage costs. Sampled retention is currently only available for spans data.

## Retention Policy Details

### When Retention is Applied

Retention periods are applied at the time data is ingested, based on the then-current plan. This means plan upgrades or downgrades affect retention for new data only; existing data retains its original retention period.

## Extended Retention

When data reaches the end of its retention period, it can no longer be accessed. If you need to retain data beyond the standard retention period, consider:

- Upgrading to a plan with longer retention
- Contacting support for enterprise retention options
