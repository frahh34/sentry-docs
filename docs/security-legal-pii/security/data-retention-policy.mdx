## Overview

Sentry retains different types of data for varying periods based on your plan tier and the specific data type. This policy outlines the retention periods for all data types across our Developer, Team, and Business plans.

## Data Retention by Plan

| Data Type | Developer | Team | Business |
|-----------|-----------|------|----------|
| [Errors](/concepts/key-terms/enrich-data/) | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| [Logs](/product/explore/logs/) | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days |
| [Spans/Transactions](/concepts/key-terms/tracing/distributed-tracing/) | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days + 13 months sampled |
| [Session Replays](/product/explore/session-replay/web/) | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| [Profiles](/product/explore/profiling/) | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days |
| [Crons](/product/crons/) | 30 days | 30 days | 30 days |
| [Uptime](/product/monitoring/) | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |
| [Attachments](/product/issues/issue-details/attachments/) | 30 days | 90 days | 90 days |

## Sampled Retention for Business Plans

Business plan customers receive extended retention for spans data through our sampled retention feature. This provides:

- **Full fidelity data**: 30 days of complete span data
- **Sampled data**: 13 months of downsampled span data at 1/8 fidelity

The 13-month sampled retention period allows for year-over-year comparisons and trend analysis while maintaining reasonable storage costs. Sampled retention is currently only available for spans data.

## Retention Policy Details

### When Retention is Applied

Retention periods are set at the time data is ingested. This means:

- Data ingested before a retention policy change will continue to be retained according to the policy in effect at the time of ingestion
- Only new data ingested after a policy change will be subject to the new retention period
- Plan upgrades or downgrades affect retention for new data only; existing data retains its original retention period

## Compliance and Legal Considerations

Our retention policies are designed to balance operational needs with compliance requirements. We work closely with our legal and security teams to ensure our retention periods meet regulatory requirements while providing value to our customers.

For enterprise customers with specific compliance needs, we may offer custom retention periods upon request. Contact your Sentry representative for more information about enterprise retention options.

## Data Deletion

When data reaches the end of its retention period, it is automatically deleted from our systems. This deletion is permanent and cannot be reversed. If you need to retain data beyond the standard retention period, consider:

- Upgrading to a plan with longer retention
- Exporting data before the retention period expires
- Contacting support for enterprise retention options
